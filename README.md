# Network Design (Optimization) for Home Care Services Using LP (pulp library)  

## Case Background:

ComfortHealth is a reputable home care agency based in Canada, dedicated to providing quality medical care and support to patients within the comfort of their homes. The agency has witnessed a significant increase in demand for its services due to a growing ageing population and extensive government incentives, expanding the company's reach.

The importance of home care in Canada cannot be overstated, as it has proven to be a strategic area that contributes to the overall improvement of the quality of care provided, postpones institutionalization, and significantly reduces the operational costs of hospitals.

As a data consultant hired by the firm, my primary objective is to create a comprehensive three-year annual service plan for ComfortHealth, detailing the hiring and allocation of the workforce and medical facilities. This plan will also outline how the agency intends to serve the various geographical areas covered by ComfortHealth during the next three years.

To ensure the effective execution of the annual service plan, a thorough analysis of the current and projected demand for home care services must be conducted. This analysis will serve as a guide to determine the number of healthcare professionals needed and the optimal allocation of medical facilities.
